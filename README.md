# auto-park
overnight parking form to fill out in local town of residence. bookmarking a puppeteer based idea.

the form asks for make, model, first name, email etc. can probably auto-fill the form if it's legal to do so.
// might make a mock version with manually duplicated form instead of using local town's website to auto complete inputs.
